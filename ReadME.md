# HalloweenMatchGame

Halloween themed match game. Match the images to their partners before the clock runs out.

Functionality to add:
	-randomize how the pictures appear - they are currently hard-coded, but should be dynamically generated/set
	-error checking (user clicked same card twice, user clicks 'Go!' button again, etc.
	-as user passes each level, it will get harder and more pictures will be shown to match and/or they will have less time to match
	-depending on the time of year (closest holiday), display the corresponding cards
		-closest holiday is Halloween? show these cards; closest holiday is Christmas? show these cards instead
		-update background and styles to match
